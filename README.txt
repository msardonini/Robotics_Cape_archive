4) Make sure the Robotics cape is plugged into your BBB


5) Log in as root and execute the install.sh script. You will be prompted with
   further instructions. Reboot when complete.

   root@beaglebone:~#cd Robotics_Cape_Installer
   root@beaglebone:~/Robotics_Cape_Installer# bash install.sh
   root@beaglebone:~/Robotics_Cape_Installer# reboot


6) If all went well, restarting will result in the selected example
   program loading on boot. For the balance example, a red LED will turn on 
   once the BBB has completely booted beofre turning green a few seconds later
   to indicate it is ready to be picked up to start balancing.
   If the blink example was selected, both red and green LEDs should be
   responsive to button presses. 


7) There should be a new folder located at /root/Auto_Run_Programs containing 
   the program you elected to run on boot. Any binaries placed in this folder 
   will be started automatically on boot once the robotics cape overlay and all
   drivers necessary for robotics cape function are ready.
