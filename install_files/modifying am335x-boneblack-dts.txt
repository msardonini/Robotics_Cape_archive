The robotics cape requires speeding up I2C2 to 400khz. This has to be done in the am335x-boneblack.dtb file since this enables the I2C bus before cape-specific device tree overlays are loaded.

Rlease-specific modified copies are included in the 2015-03-01 and 2014-05-14 folders. To make these modified versions I used the following procedure:

decompile the original dtb file to a human-readable dts
 dtc -I dtb -O dts -o am335x-boneblack.dts -@  am335x-boneblack.dtb

 find the I2C3 definition and change the clock-frequency to 400khz: 0x61a80 in hex
 
 i2c@4819c000 {
			compatible = "ti,omap4-i2c";
			#address-cells = <0x1>;
			#size-cells = <0x0>;
			ti,hwmods = "i2c3";
			reg = <0x4819c000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0x1e>;
			status = "okay";
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <0x7>;
			clock-frequency = <0x61a80>;
			linux,phandle = <0x27>;
			phandle = <0x27>;
			
			
Save the dts, and recompile to a dtb with

 dtc -O dtb -o am335x-boneblack.dtb -b 0 am335x-boneblack.dts
 
Now replace the original dtb with your new one. In the 2014-05-14 release it's in
 /boot/uboot/dtbs/
 
In the 20150-03-01 release it's in 
 /boot/dtbs/3.8.13-bone70/
